# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Install a headless Wayland desktop (compositor + terminal + VNC bridge) into
# the current guest root, for the Workspace "Display" applet. Installs:
#   labwc    - wlroots-based Wayland compositor (headless backend, no
#              DRM/udev/seatd needed -- see start-wayland.sh); the default
#              compositor -- floating/stacking windows, right-click menu,
#              themed to match the app's own Workspace look
#   sway     - a second wlroots-based compositor, kept installed as a
#              WAYLAND_COMPOSITOR_CMD=sway alternative (tiling by default,
#              keybinding-driven instead of a menu)
#   wofi     - dmenu-style app launcher, invoked by sway's Alt+d binding
#              (only relevant if you switch to sway)
#   foot     - lightweight Wayland terminal, the default first app
#   wayvnc   - VNC server for wlroots compositors; the applet's native RFB
#              client connects to it over TCP
# Also installs (best-effort, won't block the above): htop, btop, mc,
# neovim, vim -- so the Display applet's Applications menu (list-apps.sh,
# see start-wayland.sh) isn't nearly empty on a fresh rootfs. That menu just
# reflects whatever's already installed with a .desktop file; with nothing
# beyond the required packages above it would only ever show foot's own
# three entries.
#
# Run as root:
#       sudo sh /AOK/tools/setup-wayland.sh
#   or  doas sh /AOK/tools/setup-wayland.sh
#
# Devuan (apt) is supported now; Arch (pacman) installs the same stack (all
# ten packages carry identical names in the Arch repos); Alpine (apk) is a
# documented follow-up (the packages exist in edge/community but haven't
# been bring-up-tested the way the Devuan path has -- see
# wayland_workspace_plan.md phase 0).
#
# Only amd64/x86_64 has been bring-up-tested (cage/labwc + wlroots' headless
# backend + wayvnc, verified both in the CLI harness and on-device). Other
# guest arches may work -- the packages exist for them in Devuan -- but
# haven't been verified, so this script warns rather than refuses.

# tools (qv4l2, qvidcap) with their own .desktop files -- so they show up in

# dependency for those two tools specifically, so the package manager never
# installs it automatically, and this headless setup has no Xwayland to fall
# back on either -- without this, those two menu entries are silently broken
# from a fresh install (dynamic linker error; no window, no visible error at
