# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Launch the headless Wayland desktop for the Workspace "Display" applet:
# labwc (compositor) + foot (first terminal) + wayvnc (VNC bridge target).
# Runs in the foreground as the session leader of a pseudo-terminal owned by
# DisplayViewController (the same pty-backed session mechanism
# TerminalViewController uses, minus the visible terminal UI); closing the
# applet hangs up that pty, which delivers SIGHUP here. TERM/INT are also
# trapped for when something signals this script directly (e.g. testing it
# by hand from a shell). Requires labwc, foot, wayvnc on PATH -- run
# /AOK/tools/setup-wayland.sh once first if they're missing.
#
# Env overrides (all optional):
#   WAYVNC_PORT       TCP port wayvnc listens on (default 5901; 5900 is
#                      commonly taken by other VNC/screen-sharing services)
#   WAYLAND_COMPOSITOR_CMD
#                      compositor invocation (default: "labwc"). cage is
#                      NOT supported here -- its virtual-keyboard keycodes
#                      are off by evdev's +8 offset and foot silently drops
#                      every key (see wayland_workspace_plan.md phase 0).
#                      labwc is a floating/stacking compositor (normal
#                      desktop-style windows, right-click menu) -- tried
#                      "sway" (tiling, keybinding-driven) for a while
#                      instead, since labwc's menu had been unreliable, but
#                      that turned out to be a real kernel signal/poll
#                      deadlock the menu's fork/exit pattern triggered (see
#                      project memory project_signalfd_sighand_poll_
#                      deadlock.md), now fixed -- and sway's tiling-by-
#                      default layout (every window fullscreen until you
#                      float/resize it) wasn't the desktop feel this applet
#                      wants anyway. "sway" still works as an alternative if
#                      you prefer it; both get installed by setup-wayland.sh.
#   ISH_DISPLAY_READY_FILE
#                      path this script writes "$WAYVNC_PORT\n" to once
#                      wayvnc is confirmed listening (default
#                      /tmp/ish-display.ready). DisplayViewController polls
#                      for this rather than trying to parse this script's
#                      pty-carried stdout, which goes through the terminal
#                      emulator's escape-sequence parser, not a plain pipe.
#                      Removed on exit and (defensively) at startup, in case
#                      a previous run was killed hard enough to skip cleanup.
#                      On any die() below, "$ISH_DISPLAY_READY_FILE.error" is
#                      written instead with the failure reason, so
#                      DisplayViewController's poll can surface the actual
#                      cause (compositor/foot/wayvnc crash, timeout, etc.)
#                      immediately instead of only ever reporting its own
#                      generic "timed out waiting" after the full deadline.
#
# Fixed for v1 (matches wayland_workspace_plan.md phase 2.5): the headless
# output is wlroots' default size (1280x720); the applet's native RFB client
# (DisplayRFBClient/DisplayRFBView) scales to fit. Per-session resizable
# output is a follow-up, not built here.
#
# First-run only, a labwc setup gets seeded under $HOME/.config/labwc/ and
# $HOME/.local/share/themes/ (see below): a right-click root menu (New
# Terminal, an Applications submenu listing whatever's apt-installed,
# Reconfigure, Exit), a handful of Alt-based keybindings for the same
# actions (DisplayRFBView.m forwards Alt/Alt+Shift+<letter> and Alt+Return
# as their own UIKeyCommands for this -- Control stays free for in-terminal
# Ctrl combos), and a themerc styled after the app's own Workspace "Graphite"
# palette (dark background, mint-accented active window/menu highlights)
# instead of labwc's plain stock look.

# Seed labwc's setup: without this, labwc falls back to its compiled-in
# root menu, which is just "Reconfigure"/"Exit" and gives no way to launch
# anything beyond the one foot window this script starts. The
# "Applications" entry is a labwc pipemenu -- labwc runs list-apps.sh and
# expects an <openbox_pipe_menu> XML fragment on stdout, regenerated every
# time that submenu opens -- so whatever gets apt-installed later shows up
# automatically, no menu.xml edits needed.
#
# Root-caused on-device (m4pt, /tmp/ish-wayland-debug.log): labwc enforces a
# hard PIPEMENU_TIMEOUT_IN_MS of 4000ms (src/menu/menu.c upstream) and kills
# the pipemenu process if it's not done by then -- "[pipemenu N] timeout
# reached, killing list-apps.sh". The one-awk-process-per-.desktop-file
# version (already a big improvement over the original ~9-forks-per-file
# version, and what fixed a real kernel signal/poll deadlock its fork/exit
# burst triggered, see project memory project_signalfd_sighand_poll_
# deadlock.md) still ran fine standalone (~0.35s for 11 files) but
# apparently not always fast enough once labwc's own event loop is also
# busy servicing the click that opened the menu. A single awk invocation
# processing every .desktop file in one pass (FNR==1 marks a new file,
# flushing the previous one's entry) cuts this to exactly one `sh` + one
# `awk` process total regardless of app count, measured at ~0.065s for the
# same 11 files (~5x faster, far more consistent run to run) -- comfortably
# inside the timeout even under load. Also switched Execute's command from
# a nested <command> child element to the command="" attribute form, matching
# every example in labwc's own docs (both plain and forms of "&", "<", ">",
# and now quote marks too need escaping in attribute values, unlike element
# text).
#
# Also root-caused on-device: btop/htop/neovim/mc/mcedit installed but not
# launching from the menu at all. Their .desktop files (unlike foot's) all
# declare Terminal=true -- the freedesktop spec's way of saying "this is a
# TUI app, wrap it in a terminal emulator before running it", since a bare
# curses/ncurses program has no pty/window of its own to render into.
# list-apps.sh was ignoring that field entirely and running the raw Exec=
# command directly, so anything with Terminal=true silently did nothing
# (no error, no output, since there was no terminal for one to appear in).
# Fixed by parsing Terminal=true and prefixing "foot " onto the command in
# that case; confirmed on-device that `foot btop` spawns a real foot window

# both bash and dash, and killing that pid does NOT kill `cmd` (it keeps
# running with its output silently discarded once tee's read end closes).
# cleanup() below relies on COMPOSITOR_PID/WAYVNC_PID/FOOT_PID actually
# being the real processes to signal them -- with the old `| tee` pipeline
# form, `kill "$COMPOSITOR_PID"` was killing tee, not the compositor, and
# whether the compositor happened to exit anyway depended on it dying from
# the broken pipe (SIGPIPE) or the pty hangup's SIGHUP reaching the whole
# process group by luck -- which apparently differs between labwc and sway,
# since this surfaced as Reconnect/reopen hanging or racing a still-alive
# stale session only after the switch to sway. Routing each process's
# output through its own named FIFO into a separate `tee` reader instead
# means `$!` right after launching the real command (no pipe on that line)
# is correct, fixing this deterministically for every compositor, not just
# whichever one happens to die from a broken pipe. Must be called directly
# (not via `$(...)`), which would put the backgrounded jobs in a subshell
# and reparent them away before this script's own `wait` calls can see them.
# Sets $SPAWN_PID for the caller to read immediately after the call.
