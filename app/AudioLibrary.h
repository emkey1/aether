//  Bridges the audio player to the filesystem. Two sources, per the design:
//
//    1. The default music folder /AOK/persist/music — a realfs mount backed by
//       the AppGroup container, so it survives root switches and its files are
//       directly host-readable (AVFoundation opens them with no copy).
//
//    2. Any other guest path the user points at (e.g. /root/music inside an
//       Alpine root). Those live in the per-root SQLite fakefs and are NOT host
//       files, so they're read through the emulated VFS (generic_open) and
//       extracted to a temp file the decoder can open.
//
//  Also owns playlist persistence (JSON files under /AOK/persist/playlists).
//
